The scripts are [Jupytext `py:percent` format](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html#the-percent-format), meaning that they can be run normally as Python scripts or opened as notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Check them out on Binder: [![Run examples on Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zmoon/blpd/HEAD?urlpath=lab/tree/examples)

In the JupyterLab interface, right click on a `*.py` to open it as notebook.
